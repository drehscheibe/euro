euro.sty
========

This package converts arbitrary national currency amounts
using the Euro as base unit, and typesets monetary amounts
in almost any desired way. Write e.g. \ATS{17.6} to get
something like `17,60 \"oS  (1,28 Euro)' automatically.
Conversion rates for the so-called Euro-zone countries
are already built-in. Further rates can be added easily.

Extracting the package & processing the documentation
=====================================================  

 (1)  run `euro.dtx' through LaTeX to get `euro.ins',
      (if you don't already have it)

 (2)  run `euro.ins' through (La)TeX to get
      the package `euro.sty'

      [or use `docstrip', and extract `euro.sty' from `euro.dtx'
       using option `package']

 (3)  now run `euro.dtx' three times through LaTeX
      to get the documentation file `euro.dvi'



This package needs the fp-package!
